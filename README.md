# Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM
Introduction
Trying to predict how the securities exchange will work is one of the most difficult tasks. There are so many variables involved with the expectation – physical elements versus psychological factors, rational and irrational behaviour, and so on.
All of these factors combine to make share costs unpredictable and difficult to predict with any degree of certainty.
AI approaches will potentially reveal examples and insights we hadn’t seen before, and these can be used to make unerringly exact expectations, using features like the most recent declarations of an organization.
We will work with published information regarding a freely recorded organization’s stock costs in this report.
We’ll use a combination of AI calculations to forecast this company’s future stock price with LSTM.
Problem Statement
Stock market investments generate great profits and is a fundamental stimulus for most of the market researchers in this area.

Most researchers use either technical or fundamental analysis.

Technical Analysis:
Technical analysis focuses on analyzing the direction of prices to predict future prices.

Fundamental Analysis:
Fundamental analysis depends on analyzing unstructured textual information like financial news and earning reports.Performing fundamental analysis using machine learning techniques is quite interesting as it's mostly based on analysing text and sentiments.

We need to solve the problem statement in an unsupervised way which could be a hit or miss in many situations.

The problem statement here comes under regression type where the features are made up of past data feeds and the target is the current value.
